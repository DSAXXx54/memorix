# Memorix Documentation

Use this page as the fastest path to the right Memorix document.

The public docs are organized by user intent:

- **Start**: install Memorix and run `memorix setup` for an agent
- **Use**: memory search, Git Memory, dashboard, and the optional bundled terminal agent
- **Operate**: configuration, Docker, performance, troubleshooting
- **Integrate**: MCP tools, CLI, SDK, agent rules, hooks, plugins, skills
- **Understand**: architecture and deeper implementation notes
- **Develop**: contributor workflow and release checks

## Current Product Line

These docs target the **1.1 release line**, where:

- `memorix setup --agent <agent> --global` is the default agent integration command
- `memorix serve` remains the manual stdio MCP server for external agents
- `memorix background start` runs the shared HTTP MCP service and dashboard
- `memorix integrate --agent <agent>` and `memorix hooks install --agent <agent>` remain manual/fallback generation commands
- `memorix` / `memcode` open memcode, the bundled terminal agent that uses the same Memorix memory pool
- `~/.memorix/config.toml` and project `memorix.toml` are the user-facing configuration model
- legacy `memorix.yml`, `.env`, and `config.json` files are compatibility inputs, not the primary setup path
